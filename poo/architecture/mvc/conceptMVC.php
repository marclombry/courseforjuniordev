/*
 * MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software design pattern that separates an application into three main components:
 *
 * 1. Model (M): Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database, processes data, and contains business rules.
 *
 * 2. View (V): Represents the presentation layer of the application. It displays data to users and captures user input. Views are typically HTML templates with embedded PHP or other template languages.
 *
 * 3. Controller (C): Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View components. It processes user requests, retrieves data from the Model, and decides which View to render based on user actions.
 *
 * Key principles of MVC:
 *
 * - Separation of Concerns: Each component (Model, View, Controller) has a specific role and responsibility, making the application easier to manage and maintain.
 *
 * - Modularity: Changes in one component (e.g., updating business logic in the Model) do not directly impact other components (e.g., View rendering).
 *
 * - Reusability: Components can be reused across different parts of the application or even in other applications, promoting code reuse and scalability.
 *
 * Example: Implementing MVC in PHP involves creating separate classes or files for Models (data handling and business logic), Views (presentation layer), and Controllers (request handling and data flow).
 *
 * By following MVC principles, developers can create well-organized, maintainable, and testable applications that support separation of concerns and promote code reusability.
