/*
 * Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters architecture) is a design pattern that promotes a modular and flexible architecture for software applications.
 * It aims to separate the core application logic (business logic) from external concerns such as databases, user interfaces, and third-party services.
 *
 * Key principles of Hexagonal Architecture:
 *
 * 1. Core Business Logic: The application's core logic is encapsulated within the hexagon, representing the essential functionality and domain-specific rules.
 *
 * 2. Ports: Define interfaces or contracts that represent interactions with external systems (e.g., database repositories, HTTP clients).
 *
 * 3. Adapters: Implement the ports, adapting external systems to fit the application's needs. Adapters can be database repositories, web controllers, or other external interfaces.
 *
 * 4. Inversion of Control (IoC): Dependencies are injected into the hexagon through ports and adapters, allowing flexibility in how external systems are integrated and tested.
 *
 * 5. Testability: Hexagonal Architecture promotes testability by isolating core logic from external dependencies. Mocks or stubs can be used to test the application's behavior in different scenarios.
 *
 * Example: Implementing Hexagonal Architecture in PHP involves defining interfaces (ports) for interacting with external systems and providing adapter implementations for these interfaces.
 *
 * By following Hexagonal Architecture, developers can create applications that are more modular, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements, while also improving testability and reducing coupling.
