/*
 * Microservices architecture is an approach to building software applications as a collection of small, loosely coupled services.
 * Each service is developed, deployed, and maintained independently, focusing on a single business capability.
 *
 * Key principles of microservices architecture:
 *
 * 1. Service Independence: Each microservice is self-contained and focused on a specific business domain or capability.
 *
 * 2. Decentralized Data Management: Services manage their own data storage, which can be either a separate database or a schema within a shared database.
 *
 * 3. Communication via APIs: Microservices communicate with each other through lightweight protocols (e.g., HTTP/REST or messaging) and APIs.
 *
 * 4. Resilience and Fault Tolerance: Services are designed to handle failures gracefully. A failure in one service should not cascade to other services.
 *
 * 5. Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on specific requirements (e.g., more instances of high-demand services).
 *
 * Example: Implementing microservices in PHP involves creating small, focused services, each with its own codebase, database, and API endpoints.
 *
 * By following microservices architecture, developers can achieve better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability, allowing teams to work independently and deploy updates more frequently.
